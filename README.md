# Text-Based Car Simulation Game

A simple Python terminal game to simulate a car engine using typed commands.

## üîß Files

- `car_game_original.py`: The first version of the game using a variable-controlled loop.
- `car_game_polished.py`: An improved version using boolean logic and cleaner loop control.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

- Type `START` to start the car.
- Type `STOP` to stop it.
- Type `QUIT` to end the game.

**Note:** All inputs are case-insensitive.

I created it for some fun and practice. I wanted to learn more uses of boolean in loops and wanted to polish my skills.
